Hidden Element - Created script to click the start button and scrape dynamically loaded text ("Hello World!") utilizing unique xpath and explicit wait. Sleep timer added since the browser closed too quickly before the text even loaded up.

Image Search - Browser will search anything that is inputted within the quotations in Line 9 (i.e. Eiffel Tower, The White House, and Brad Pitt) and click on images of searched text
