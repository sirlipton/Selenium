Hidden Element - Created script to click the start button and scrape dynamic rendering of text with a delay ("Hello World!") utilizing unique xpath and explicit wait. Sleep timer was added since the browser closed too quickly before the text even loaded up.

Image Search - Browser will search anything that is inputted within the quotations in Line 9 (i.e. Eiffel Tower, The White House, and Brad Pitt) and click on images of searched text
